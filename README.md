**INTRODUCTION**

1.1 During the time of pandemic we notice that the hospital  where full of covid patient in such condition, it was very difficult for the people who have other problem to book an  appointment with doctors. For that they need to visit hospital and then wait for hours   for their number in  hospital. in between people who may have an infection. So , it seems to be very risky for them to visit a hospital for their treatment. And also, some hospitals had closed the general OPD for the patients. By considering all these things we decide to make and project of hospital website form where any one and book an appointment with and doctor they want  at any time and from anywhere. 
 
1.2 Our project report is on "Hospital Website". In this website, we are giving detailed information about the hospital and its operations. The website is designed in an interactive manner and is able to give the users the knowledge of the expertise, experience and hospitality of the hospital. Through this website patients can get information not only about the expertise field but also the eminence of the hospital. The patients would be able to get daily updates of their queries and they can go through the profiles of the doctors. All the departments of the hospital have senior and experienced heads and the website gives all the necessary information about them. The website consists of webpage giving information about the appointment availability, latest updates and news of hospital. The events held by the hospital are showcased in a different section of the website giving it a communicative view. This website also consists of hyperlinks such as rules and regulations, contact us and so on. From these hyperlinks, we can get to know what are the rules and regulations of the hospital and patient's feedback about the information that they acquire from the website and they can also comment and express their views on it. Our website also helps to connect the common people with the hospital and they can now get to know each and everything about the hospital and can book appointments with doctors. A different section has been provided for contacting the hospital for any queries. 
1.3 These website will provide and interface to a user from  which they can select the particular department in which        
 
1.4 They need treatment and want to meet a doctor department,neurology,nephrology,orthopedic,cardiology,eye- care,dentist,general).   Here they will find and list of doctors for each department with their basic data hence user can choose their doctor on their choice from whom they want to consult and then  fill and appointment form to book and appointment  that data will be store in local host and hence can visit hospital at particular time they have chosen. 
 
1.5 This project is based on web development and DBMS, these is  consisting of mainly 4 languages (HTML, CSS, JAVA SCRIPT,  MSQL).  and software like vscode, xampp. 
 
1.6 In vscode software we have made an website using HTML,CSS  and JAVA SCRIPT 
 
1.7 And by using xampp and phpMyAdmin we have stored the data filled in form in local   database in backend     
  
 
 
**PROBLEMS IN EXISTING SYSTEM** 

1.	Earlier the records were kept done manually which was highly time consuming and expensive. 
2.	There can be no interaction between the patients and doctors. 
3.	Patients used to stand in long queues. 
4.	Wastage of Stationary other material resources increase due to paper work. 
5.	Current manual system requires large efforts to compile information. 
6.	With the increase in data, the processes of maintaining, updating and storing of information are becoming difficult 
7.	Data extraction becomes difficult as one has to search among large pile of papers. 
 
**OBJECTIVES OF PROPOSED SYSTEM:** 
 
1.	This system helps in lowering manual work done by the patients to get appointments of doctors in a single click. It helps in keeping the patients updated about the availability of doctors. 
2.	Nowadays, it has become easy to get information through websites. No newspaper, magazines and interviews etc are required because each and every information is easily available on the website.

2.6 I have made backend database to store data using xampp and phpmyadmin and done some other designing work of our project. 
2.7 Futher we have created a backend database using xampp and phpMyAdmin software tool which allow user to fill the data in  the form and that data is stored in the local host for father access. 
2.8 We tried to keep our project user friendly and easy to use and understand with a limited knowledge we tried to cover every  aspect of an website.

**CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE**

4.1) FUTURE SCOPE:
	Daily functions like patient registration, monitoring blood bank, managing admission and overall management of various departments can be easily performed with higher accuracy after the installation of hospital software.
	The modules of hospital management software are user-friendly and easy to access. It has a common user friendly interface having several modules. The officials can utilize these modules in their processes without any hassle and make the best possible use of hospital management system.
	Since, every hospital has some or the other points of worth those vary in comparison with to its competitors. Hence, most of the IT companies give on-demand solutions or feature of customization. It further implicates that hospital information management software can be customized by specifying personal requirements of the campus.
	The automated functions of online hospital software make productivity effective. This web based IT solution has automated operations and permit officials to continue with their work in a swift manner.

**CONCLUSION:**

We can conclude that our hospital website is Quite Useful To Us In many ways. Everyone needs to be well informed and concerned about the quality of care. Everyone means patients and their families, consumer agents and advocates, health professionals, administrators of health plans and facilities, purchasers of health care services, and policymakers at all levels. The messages to these audiences are:-

1)	Quality of care can be measured and improved. 

2)	Quality of care should not be ignored in pursuit of cost control. Reinforcing these messages means making sure that quality of care stays on the health care-delivery agenda, with clear identification of the risks and opportunities that are posed by the changes in health care in the United States. It also means describing how health plans, health care organizations, and clinicians should be accountable to patients and society and, conversely, how individuals can take appropriate responsibility for their own health.
